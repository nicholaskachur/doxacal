# doxacal &mdash; Orthodox Christian Calendar

`doxacal` hopes to provide yet another interface to the daily life of
the Orthodox Christian Church.

The aim is to start with a simple command-line utility that can present
the day's readings, saints and feasts. Further work might integrate
email, web API, and web UI components.
